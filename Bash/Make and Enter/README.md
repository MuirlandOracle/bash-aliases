# Make and Enter
### Small function used to make a new directory and enter it in the same command

Usage:
1. Copy the contents of `mkae` into your `~/.bash_aliases` file
2. Execute `source ~/.bashrc` to bring the function into your current terminal session
3. Use the function in the same way you would `mkdir` -- it will move you directly into the new directory tree.
