## Webserving
### Aliases used to start webservers. 

Currently consists entirely of "up", which is my own implementation of the classic:
* Lists all files in the current directory
* Lists all IPv4 addresses being available to the machine
* Starts a Python3 webserver on port 80

Usage:
1. Add the alias command from `up` into your `~/.bash_aliases` file
2. Resource your bashrc: `~/.bashrc`
3. Use `up` to start the server
